## Background

I am currently working at <http://ghcg.com> making Adobe Flex/Air user interfaces 
for automated trading systems. My interest is concise creation of human usable software.
I believe that good development practices is the way to deal with ever growing complexity of today's software projects. But you gotta be smart and don't make the practices your dogma. You need to experiment sometimes to improve the current practices and create the new ones. 

## Systems Proficiency

**Programming Languages**

 > Proficient in:  ActionScript 1/2/3, Flex 3/4, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

 > Experience with: PHP, Ruby, CouchDB

**Software**

 > I have experience using most of the IDEs for flash development including Flash Builder, FDT, FlashDevelop. My current tool of choice is IntelliJ Idea. For simple coding tasks I really like to use TextMate. I am experienced OS X user. Sometimes I use Linux and I try to avoid Windows as much as possible.
 > I consider myself an experienced Flash IDE user. I also have experience of other Adobe Creative Suite applications related to graphic and motion design.
